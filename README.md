# Python Console Chess Game

This is a simple chess game implemented in Python. The game allows two players to play against each other through the console.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**:
   - Run the `chess.py` file using Python.
   - The format for a valid move input is `current_position destination_position`, where `current_position` and `destination_position` are in the format `<letter><number>`. For example, `A2 A4` means moving the piece from square A2 to square A4.
   - The game alternates between White and Black players. Follow the on-screen prompts.

2. **Exiting the Game**:
   - To exit the game at any time, type "Exit" when prompted to make a move.

3. **Special Moves**:
   - The game includes special moves like castling and pawn promotion.
   - Castling: To castle, move the King two squares towards the Rook, and the Rook will move to the opposite side of the King.
   - Pawn Promotion: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (Queen, Knight, Rook, or Bishop).
